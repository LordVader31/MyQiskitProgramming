# MyQiskitProgramming

This repository contains all my experimentation with the Qiskit API and all the Python scripts on Jupyter Notebook(s) written to test out circuits on a quantum computer. Lots of the codes and the material is borrowed from the [Qiskit video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1NZC5rqQD8&list=PLOFEBzvs-Vvp2xg9-POLJhQwtVktlYGbY) on learning to code with quantum computers and the [textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-states/introduction.html). This repository will cover 

### Quantum Experimentation
* Hello World ✅
* Experiments with Gates ✅
* Solutions to Qiskit Textbook Problems ⏺

### Quantum Algorithms
* Berstein-Vazirani Algorithm ✅
* Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm ✅
* Grover's Quantum Search 
* Simon's Algorithm ⏺
* Shor's Algorithm (with QFT) 

### Quantum Games
* Quantum Pong

and plain 'ol messing around.....

 ### Official Documentation
 
 My implementation of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is thoroughly explained for beginners and experts alike on my Medium and Dev.to post(s) cited below. (_In Progress_)

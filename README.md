# MyQiskitProgramming

This repository contains all my experimentation with the Qiskit API and all the Python scripts on Jupyter Notebook(s) written to test out circuits on a quantum computer. Lots of the codes and the material is borrowed from the [Qiskit video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1NZC5rqQD8&list=PLOFEBzvs-Vvp2xg9-POLJhQwtVktlYGbY) on learning to code with quantum computers and the [textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-states/introduction.html). This repository will cover 
* Hello World
* Experiments with Gates
* Quantum Half Adder
* Quantum Full Adder
* Quantum Half Subtractor
* Quantum MUX / DMUX
* Berstein-Vazirani Algorithm
* Simon's Algoritm
* Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm
* Grover's Quantum Search
* Quatum Eingensolver
* Quantum Fourier Transform
* Shor's Algorithm (with QFT)
* Quantum Pong

and plain 'ol messing around.....

 ### Official Documentation
 
 My implementation of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is thoroughly explained for beginners and experts alike on my Medium and Dev.to post(s) cited below.

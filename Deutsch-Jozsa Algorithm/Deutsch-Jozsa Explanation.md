## Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm

### Background
Consider a blackbox function *f:{0,1} -> {0,1}* at takes in a single bit and outputs a single bit. Assume that this blackbox function is a very time consuming function that takes 24 hours to compute a result. Now to determine f(0) and f(1), we would need 48 hours. For a classical computation, 48 hours are mandatory. Can quantum computers do any better? This is called Deustch's problem.
